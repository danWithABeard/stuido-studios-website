No oral or written advice provided by Licensor or any authorized representative shall create a warranty. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.</p>

        <p>12.2 Except as set forth above, this warranty is in lieu of all other warranties, whether oral or written, express or implied, including any other warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement, and no other representations or warranties of any kind shall be binding on Licensor.</p>

        <p>13.4 BECAUSE SOME STATES/COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS AND/OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, DEATH, OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, THESE LIMITATIONS AND/OR EXCLUSIONS AND ANY EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OTHERWISE RESULTING FROM THE ABOVE INDEMNITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY SHALL NOT BE APPLICABLE SOLELY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SPECIFIC PROVISION OF THIS WARRANTY IS PROHIBITED BY ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR MUNICIPAL LAW, WHICH CANNOT BE PRE-EMPTED.

        <h4>14 TERMINATION</h4>

        <p>14.1 This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or by the Licensor. This Agreement automatically terminates when Licensor ceases to operate the Software servers (for games exclusively operated online), if Licensor determines or believes your use of the Software involves or may involve fraud or money laundering or any other illicit activity, or upon your failure to comply with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the License Conditions above. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by (i) requesting Licensor to terminate and delete your User Account that is used to access or use the Software using the method set forth in the Terms of Service (if applicable) or (ii) destroying and/or deleting any and all copies of all Software in your possession, custody, or control.</p>

You shall provide copies of any and all exemption certificates to Licensor if you are entitled to any exemption. All expenses and costs incurred by you in connection with your activities hereunder, if any, are your sole responsibility. You are not entitled to reimbursement from Licensor for any expenses, and will hold Licensor harmless therefrom.</p>
